# Pisano-Periods
# This repo is influenced by the YouTube Channel "Numberphile's" video called "Fibonacci Mystery". You should check it out here "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu-lW-Ifyec". This repo consist of three Python codes: 1)fib.py: This one generates a file with the first 10000 fibonacci numbers in it \n 2) ParseRem.py: This one creates as many files as you input as the high end of the for loop embedded. All the files include the modulo or remainders of the fibonacci series when you divide it by 2,3,4.... all the way up to the high end that you input \n 3) doperiods.py: This one makes use of class structures in python and generates one last file that has the Pisano Period(the period at which the remainders repeat themselves).
